<h3 class="pt-5">Topic Description</h3>
<p class="pt-1 pb-3">
Data security, also known as information security (IS) or computer security, refers to protective digital privacy measures
that are applied to prevent unauthorized access to computers, databases and websites.
<br /> To ensure data security and prepare for and defend against both accidental and intentional unauthorized access, one important
aspect is confidentiality.
<br />
<br /> Confidentiality, in this context, refers to making sure that only the people who are allowed to see and interact with the
data are in fact able to do so. The technical process of figuring out who the user is, is called authentication. Only after
the user has been identified can the system display or hide the appropriate content and actions from the user.
<br /> One approach to this is giving the user some sort of secret. This is usually either a long randomly generated string that
uniquely identifies them and is known only to them, or simply a password which either the administrator or the user has previously
defined.
<br />
<br /> Since we have worked with authentification many times before, we are quite familiar with this process. There is however one
important aspect of it, cookies and sessions, which we have very limited knowledge of. There are quite a few unanswered questions,
such as how do cookies and sessions actually, technically, work. How do they fit together, which part does what etc.
<br
/> Furthermore we are quite interested in, whether there are relevant security concerns in using these technologies and what
those might be.
<br /> To get a better understanding of these topics we will conduct background research, by searching for and analysing various
sources.
<br />

<h3 class="pt-5">Research Question</h3>
<p class="research">What role do cookies and sessions play in identifying users of websites or web applications, and what risks can
their usage pose?</p>

<ul class="subquestions">
	<li>How are sessions and cookies used to keep a user logged in, even when he/she moves between different pages?</li>
	<li>How are cookies and sessions relevant, in relation to the HTTP protocol?</li>
	<li>What are some of the most common security concerns, when using sessions?</li>
</ul>

<p class="pt-3">
	 The term cookie refers to a file stored on the client-side which contents can be passed along with an HTTP request. Sessions
	are, in a way, the counterpart on the server, which store relevant information about a given user during a session/visit
	without the need for a database or something similar.
	<br /> The mentioned HTTP protocol is a specific way of transferring files on the web and is how the server and the clients commonly communicate with one another.
	<br />
